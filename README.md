## On Terrain Effects on Path Loss Models

**Abstract** — Path loss models describe the signal attenuation between a transmitter and the receiver(s) as a function of the propagation distance and other parameters, it is found very useful for interference analysis. In this paper, we investigated the effects of terrain on electromagnetic wave propagation in the VHF and UHF band. The works further assessed the performance of five widely used empirical path loss models, to achieve these, large scale field strength measurements were conducted in the VHF and UHF frequencies using two transmitters. For each transmitter, five different routes were covered simultaneously within the metropolises. The measurement results were converted to path losses using a program that was developed in MATLAB 10.0, the path loss were compared with the model’s prediction. Results show that terrain has significant effects on received signal level and prediction error. Most models available were built based on measurements conducted in regions that are different from Nigeria; suitability in terms of usage may therefore vary due to environmental factors and terrain profile (clutter). This work provides proper evaluation of some existing models, making the model give reduced prediction errors when deployed within the metropolis.
